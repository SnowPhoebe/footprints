        <p>Hi! This is Phoebe!</p>
        <p>I like novel things. I really enjoy exploring different places and meeting new people coming from all across the world. This website intends to show my footprints of visiting different places. When I was in the high school, I atteneded a Summit held by a high school, Charles Wright Academy, in Tacoma, Washington. Teenagers from all across the world come to this place, attend meaningful acitivies, and learn from each other. </p>
        <p>Then, I started my college life at Brandeis University in Boston. In this website, I intend to show some sweet memories I have at Brandeis for the first two years of my college life since I transfered to University of Michigan after that. </p>
        <p>Last but not least, I traveled to Los Angeles during winter break last year with my friend. I would like show some beautiful scenes and sweet memories I had at LA. </p>
